  SmartMenus v6.0.2
=======================
  - Compatibility fixes for newly released browsers - notable fixes for
    Konqueror 4.0 and minor for Safari 3 and the upcoming Opera 9.5. The
    window size detection code now works correctly in these browsers and is
    more future ready so it will, hopefully, not break in future browsers
  - Some other minor fixes and a fix for a serious issue in Mozilla 1.7 on
    Solaris which refused to display any sub menus with previous SmartMenus
    versions


  SmartMenus v6.0.1
=======================
  - Purely maintenance release with fixes for few issues reported by users
    and some code optimizations


  SmartMenus v6.0
=======================
  - Full support for RTL text/pages (e.g. Hebrew, Arabic) - a new global
    variable "c_rightToLeft" is added in section 1 of the configuration file
  - Massive speed improvements in IE/Windows on pages that do not have
    strict doctype declaration (the script now performs in IE practically
    equally in both standards-compliant and quirks mode)
  - Small fixes to some features (like menus opening onclick & Tab key
    navigation)
  - Some other fixes and improvements (e.g. you can now safely set any event
    handler to a menu item by using the onmouseover, onclick etc. attributes
    for the A element that represents the menu item)
  - Code optimizations and speed ups


  SmartMenus v6.0 RC1
=======================
  - Performance improvements
  - Accessibility improvements (like alt text for the sub menu indicator
    images and a bit improved Tab key navigation)
  - The script now works on XHTML pages served as XML in modern browsers
    (Mozilla, Opera, the latest Webkit nightly builds)
  - The script now uses only valid CSS (yes, hacks are used because there is
    no other way to cope with browser bugs but nonetheless all the CSS code
    the script uses/generates is now valid)
  Fixed issues found in beta3:
  - The feature that finds automatically the item that links to the current
    location (i.e. when c_findCURRENT=true;) doesn't work correctly with
    dynamic pages - e.g.:
    /index.asp?page=about
  - On secure pages (https://) IE displays a notification window that says
    that the page includes both secure and insecure items
  - In very rare cases the sub menu indicator images appear mis-aligned (at
    higher position than normally) in IE/Windows


  SmartMenus v6.0 beta3
=======================

  - The sub menus can now be configured to pop up onclick (instead of the
    default onmouseover) through new config items that are added in the MENU
    TREE FEATURES arrays in the last section of the config file
  - Improved function for detecting when the menu tree(s) are completely
    downloaded by the browser and ready for initialization is now implemented
  - If you have put configuration arrays for some menu tree(s) that are not
    available in the source of a given page, this will no longer cause a JS
    error on that page - the script will now just initialize the menu tree(s)
    that are found on the current page and will skip without error those that
    are defined in the config file but missing on the page
  - You can now set custom width for any sub menu by adding to its UL element
    style="width:value;" even when the sub menus' width is set to "auto" for
    the given menu tree in the config file
  - Code optimizations (performance and size)


  SmartMenus v6.0 beta2
=======================

  - Improved load performance in IE/Windows (especially notable on pages with
    many sub menus)
  - Support for the filter effects in IE5.5+ is now added. Please note that
    there is a very annoying bug in IE which causes serious problems when
    static filters are used (no sub menus can be displayed for the menus that
    have static filter applied). This problem does not appear with transition
    filters (the animation effects) so they can be used without worries.
  - Fixed some minor issues


  SmartMenus v6.0 beta1
=======================

  - First public release
